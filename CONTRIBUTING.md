## Call Us
Vendors with "Call Us" pricing are not currently being merged pending a change that will move them into their own table.

## Percentages
A common error with PRs is a miscalculated percentage. The site uses a "percentage increase from base price model" â€“ that is, a $5 -> $10 markup is a 100% increase, not 200%. I'm hoping that a unit test will catch these, but writing a guideline is quicker.
